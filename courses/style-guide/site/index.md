# Purpose

The goal of the *Course Development Guide* is to help instructors build
high quality courses with Shipkin which follow the below principles:

-   The content source is *readable*.
    Newcomers to the course repository are quickly able to determine the
    topics covered in a course.
    Content in source code can be read as-is and is easily mapped to the
    live course.
    The finished product is easy for students to navigate and read.
-   The material is *maintainable*.
    It is easy to make updates to the labs.
    Material in the course can be reordered and restructured with
    minimal impact.
    Topics within a course can be reshuffled as needed.
-   Instructors can *collaborate* effectively on course content.
    Structure is consistent between courses so that editors can switch
    between courses without needing to learn a new organization
    paradigm.
    Two instructors can work on the same course with minimal merge
    conflicts.

Following these principles will allow a course to improve rapidly over
time based on feedback gathered during delivery.

We divide the guide into several parts, all of which should be read
before creating, editing, or accepting course content.
